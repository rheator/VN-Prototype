Real Life model: Typhoid Mary

Wikipedia Entry: 

Mary Mallon (September 23, 1869 â€“ November 11, 1938), better known as Typhoid Mary, 
was the first person in the United States identified as an asymptomatic carrier of the pathogen 
associated with typhoid fever.

She was presumed to have infected some 50 people, three of whom died, over the course of her career as a cook.

She was forcibly isolated twice by public health authorities and died after a total of nearly three decades in isolation.

Sympathetic writeup:

Mary Mallon, now known as Typhoid Mary, seemed a healthy woman when a health inspector knocked on her door in 1907, 
yet she was the cause of several typhoid outbreaks. Since Mary was the first "healthy carrier" of typhoid fever 
in the United States, she did not understand how someone not sick could spread disease -- so she tried to fight back.

Argument against maliciousness:

Some people believe that Mallon never had any intention of following the health officials' rules; 
thus they believe Mallon had a malicious intent with her cooking. 
But not working as a cook pushed Mallon into service in other domestic positions which did not pay as well. 
Feeling healthy, Mallon still did not really believe that she could spread typhoid. 
Though in the beginning Mallon tried to be a laundress as well as worked at other jobs, 
for a reason that has not been left in any documents, 
Mallon eventually went back to working as a cook.
