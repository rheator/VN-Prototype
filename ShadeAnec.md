Character Anecdote - Shade
=========================

I hung desperately to consciousness, straining to define the blur before my eyes. The shimmering white of the frosted lands swam in my vision, and directly before me, rising from the fallen form of my attacker, was the fury of the hail and the ice incarnate. It shimmered in white and in blue in my unfocused sight, and at its heart were a pair of fiery red eyes, simmering with power and malice, burning into my own. My grip on awareness slipped, and the crimson spheres remained as fiery imprints upon my perception long after my eyes had ceased to see.

When vision returned it was of a wide, clear sky. Fresh brittle snow prickled my hair and the back of my ear, and I was aware that I lay on my back upon the snow. The cold remained bitter, but in a quiet, resentful sort of way, and I felt strangely alive, strong enough to rise. As I picked myself off the loose snow I felt a trickle of blood run from my forehead across my face onto my chin, and then drip off onto my snow-crusted glove. And yet I felt no pain, only a strange warmth, and as the blood dripped onto the snow I saw that it was red. A red deeper and richer than I can remember, almost as if it burned with its own life. One drop, two drops, it stained the snow, deep red upon powder white.

And as I took my eyes from the ground to survey my surroundings I became suddenly aware of the pair of crimson eyes trained directly at me. In a rush of fear I staggered backwards and reached for my weapon, but my body wasn't ready for the rush of adrenaline and I collapsed into the snow, which seemed to reach up and embrace me as I struggled back up to my knees to face the fiend.

But her eyes had turned downward, and it was then that I saw her for the first time. A thin, frail form, with white, feathery skin that seemed to meld smoothly into the untarnished snow. She sat with her back to a black tree stump, which helped separate her from the blinding white of the snow, her hands wrapped carelessly around her legs and her chin resting lightly on her knees. She looked like a waiting child, a child sitting by a window waiting for the storm outside to abate. But then she moved, and in a flurry of swift and fluid movements she stood lightly on her feet. With little heed for me or my fallen attacker, the shattered form of which lay frozen a dozen or so steps away, she turned and began walking lightly away, her bare feet leaving no mark upon the loose snow as she walked towards the great frozen lake and the mists that veiled it.

"Wait!"

"Wait!!"

My mind reeled as I called out into the cold air, without knowing if my words were even intelligible to her. But the second time my voice rang out, she stopped. And we stood like that, her back to me, for a seeming eternity as the winds murmured around us.

"...What ..are you?", I managed lamely at last. But I knew the answer, knew it with a keening certainty, though my battered consciousness refused to assimilate it.

She stood motionless a while more, her face slightly upturned, her hair, which was the faded blue of the frozen glacier, flowed fluidly in the wind.

"You came here to kill me" came her soft voice, a voice that was like a whispered song, that carried easily and inexplicably audibly over the murmuring winds. A voice that bore neither malice, nor resentment, nor pleading, nor sorrow. She simply spoke.

"But you cannot kill me now". she continued, turning a little in my direction, and I saw the corner of her gaze flick from my feet up to my face. That narrow, crimson slit bore into me, into and through the back of my eyes, into the very depths of my soul.
